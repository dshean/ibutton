Utility to parse and plot data from Maxim iButton temperature logger

Data collected from North Lake field camp on Greenland ice sheet during summer 2013.

Loggers were sealed in watertight PVC containers and deployed on August 14, 2013 as part of a time-lapse and GPS multipath experiment:
* -1.5 m below ice surface in borehole
* -1.0 m below ice surface in borehole
* "floating" on surface
* +1.65 m above ice surface on tower

Mostly a test of this inexpensive option for temperature loggers with ~0.5 deg C accuracy.
